# Horiseon, Inc home page refactoring

    Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Introduction

    The aim of this project was refactoring the home page of a search engine
optimization company called Horiseon, Inc. The initial code given to me lacked 
any semantic html, had unnecessary classes in both the html and css files, and
suffered from broken functionality (e.g. broken links). I streamlined the 
page by changing the abundant <div> tags to their appropriate, semantic tags,
and removed many of the redundancies found within the stylesheet. Further, 
I added comments in order to make some sense of the groupings within the css.
